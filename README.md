# reduxplayground
Scaffolding and boiler plate I can clone to easily play with React and Redux.
The 'experiments' are separated by branches:
* master - This branch. Easiest to clone/fork to play around with.
* firebase-redux - Experiment to integrate Firebase with Redux and adhere to Flux architecture philosophy.
* routing-auth - Experiment to integrate nested routing with React Router and implement Facebook auth with Firebase.
